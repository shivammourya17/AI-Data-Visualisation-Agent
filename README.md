📊 AI Data Visualization Agent

This Streamlit-based application acts as an intelligent Data Visualization Assistant that interprets natural language queries and instantly produces meaningful visualizations using Large Language Models (LLMs).

🌟 Why This Project?

The need for AI-driven data visualization tools is rapidly increasing as organizations look for quicker and more intuitive ways to analyze their data. Instead of writing code or learning complex BI platforms, users can simply type questions in plain English and receive instant insights through interactive charts and graphs.

This project aims to address that demand by providing an AI-powered visualization agent that can be easily integrated into existing data workflows.
